# Note Taking Application

  ## Description

  - The purpose of this project was to work with code that had already been written in the index.js file and build from scratch the server.js file. I decided to work on this project because it's never a good idea to miss two assignments in a row.
  - The user for this project is anyone that needs to write down any notes: so a student who has a bunch of homework due, a parent that has a list of chores for the week, or a bookworm who is working on finishing up a list of books
  - I plan on using this project to help me remember that anything is possible when you put your mind to it, and then to write down any notes I may need to take to keep up with due dates and possible tutoring sessions

  ## Installation
  
  To install this application, please follow these steps:
  
  - This project uses express.js, I ran npm install first and then followed up with npm install inquirer@8.2.4 and npm install uuid and lastly npm install express.
  
  ##Usage
  
  - You can use this project by launching the site from my deployed heroku link and then adding a new note under the title section and the notes you want to write under the write notes section. Your note will save after hitting the save button at the top of the page on the right hand side, and when you no longer want your note you can hit the red delete trashcan button to remove it from the list. All of this of course after hitting get started when you first launch the site.

  ##Contributors

  - Multiple articles on stackflow helped me figure out that I cannot use const uuid = require("uuid") to call uuid, since I am using a new version of the software I had to amend the code to reflect uuid as version 4 of uuid. Also a few youtube videos that didn't turn out to be helpful, ultimately it was the previous lessons that really helped out. 

  ## Tests

  - By deploying the link, as of right now I have not figured out the best way to test out the project from the terminal.
